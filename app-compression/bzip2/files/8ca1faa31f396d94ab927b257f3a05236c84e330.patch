Subject: [PATCH] Don't call unsafe functions from SIGSEGV/SIGBUS signal
 handler.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

GCC10 -fanalyzer notices that we try to call functions that are not
signal safe from our fatal signal handler:

bzip2.c: In function âmySIGSEGVorSIGBUScatcherâ:
bzip2.c:819:7: warning: call to âfprintfâ from within signal handler
               [CWE-479] [-Wanalyzer-unsafe-call-within-signal-handler]

It also notices we then call showFileNames and cleanupAndFail which
also call possibly not signal safe functions.

Just write out the error message directly to STDERR and exit without
trying to clean up any files.
